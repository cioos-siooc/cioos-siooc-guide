# FAIR and CARE Principles 

## FAIR Principles

A vast amount of information is now available online and continues to be generated daily by an increasingly technology-driven science. To ensure that data remains easily discoverable and accessible, certain practices can be adopted to guide this process. The FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) aim to make data discoverable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  

These are guiding principlesâ€”concepts designed to help data stewards standardize and structure their data for archiving and dissemination. The principles were defined in 2015 during a workshop held in Leiden, the Netherlands.
