# CARE Principles

The CARE principles were developed in 2018 during the *Indigenous Data Sovereignty Principles for the Governance of Indigenous Data* Workshop in Gaborone, Botswana.

These principles aim to prioritize the people and communities affected by data collection, focusing on its purpose and objectives. They complement the FAIR principles, which center data itself in the discussion.

Historically, Indigenous populations have faced issues of inequality and exploitation related to the collection of data about their communities and territories. They emphasize the need to incorporate their knowledge and approaches into data practices and policies. This is particularly important in a context where the volume of data and the desire to reuse it are increasing. As the push for open data grows, Indigenous peoples are asserting their rights and interests over data to claim control over it (Russo Carroll et al., 2020). These concerns are reflected in the CARE principles.

## Collectively Beneficial

Data systems should support inclusive development, improved governance, increased civic engagement, and equitable benefits for Indigenous communities.

## Authority to Control

The rights and interests of Indigenous peoples over their data must be recognized and respected. They should have the authority to control this data.

## Responsibility

Working with Indigenous data requires a heightened responsibility to foster positive and respectful relationships.

## Ethics

Harm should be minimized, and benefits maximized, without stigmatizing or devaluing Indigenous peoples, their cultures, or their knowledge. Future potential uses of data should be considered in data governance. The limitations and obligations related to data must be clearly stated.
