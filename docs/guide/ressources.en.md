## Species Identification

In a data table, **it is important to record the observation with its scientific name**.

Indeed, the scientific name is universally accepted and used by scientists around the world, which avoids ambiguities and errors in translation or interpretation that can occur with vernacular names, which often vary by region or language.

***Specifications for Subspecies and Varieties***

The specification for subspecies and varieties varies depending on whether the specimen is from the animal kingdom (excluding Porifera) or the plant kingdom (including Porifera). When, in the animal kingdom, it is possible to identify a specimen to the taxonomic subspecies level, it should be noted as follows: 


    *Genus species subspecies*

*ex :  	Medora dalmatina montenegrina*

When, in the plant kingdom, it is possible to identify a specimen at the taxonomic level of subspecies or variety, it should be noted as follows:

    *Genus species subsp. subspecies*

    *Genus species var. variety*

*ex : 	Fucus distichus subsp. evanescens*

    *Axinella tenuidigitata var. oxeata*
