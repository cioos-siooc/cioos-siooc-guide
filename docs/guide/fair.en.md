# FAIR Principles

Vast amounts of information are now available online and continue to be generated daily by an increasingly technology-driven science. To ensure that data remains easily discoverable and accessible, certain practices can be implemented to guide this process. The FAIR principles ( *Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable* ) aim to make data discoverable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

These are guiding principles, meaning they serve as concepts to help data managers standardize and structure their data for archiving and dissemination. These principles were defined in 2015 during a workshop held in Leiden, Netherlands.

## Findable

Data should be easy to locate for those interested in using it. This means it must be associated with rich metadata and indexed in a way that makes it discoverable through search engines or data catalogs, such as the OGSL catalog.

## Accessible

Data should be accessible, meaning it should be available for retrieval by those who need it. This often involves using standardized protocols and technologies to facilitate downloading or access through application programming interfaces (APIs). Licenses governing how open data should be used can also be applied.

## Interoperable

Data should be interoperable, meaning it should be able to be combined and used efficiently with other datasets, whether from different sources or in different formats. This often requires the use of standardized variables and structures to enable quick and effective usage.

## Reusable

Data should be reusable, meaning it should be well-documented and accompanied by appropriate licenses specifying how it can be used. This also involves providing information on data provenance, quality, and context of use.
