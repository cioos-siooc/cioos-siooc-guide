Welcome to the Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) Data Management Documentation.

This documentation outlines the general principles for effective data management and the appropriate data collection on the field. Its primary objective is to equip users for the final stages of the data lifecycle. Essentially, it aims to describe in detail the standards and data structures specific to archiving to facilitate their dissemination and, therefore, reuse.
In addition to general principles, the documentation also addresses data management concepts specific to particular data types, such as biodiversity data.


_This documentation is currently under development and will be enriched with additional information over time._
